# gsm_start [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/king-jam/gsm_start.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/king-jam/gsm_start)

Uses a Teensy 2.0 to control a GSM module for starting a car. Very simple and preliminary code. Not handling many edge cases that should be accounted for.

Needs to be expanded - build log will be linked to website soon.

Reset button to be added since software lockup is possible. Maybe watchdog instead?

Additional edit for testing.
